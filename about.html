<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer working with small businesses and 
  individuals wanting to carefully curate how their brand looks and feels online. 
  I focus on building clean, thoughtful websites and I bring a strong eye for aesthetics, layout, and branding into everything I build.</p>

<p>More than anything, I'm committed to learning. I believe in showing up, asking good questions, and problem-solving. I'm constantly improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I approach each project with curiosity, 
  care, and attention to detail.</p>

<p>I value clear communication, efficiency, and collaboration. If 
  something isn't working, let's fix it. If something can be better, let's refine it. My goal is to create websites that feel intentional, aligned with the brand, 
  and easy to use—both for the client and their audience.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who's invested, detail-oriented, and genuinely excited about 
  bringing ideas to life on the web, I'd love to work together.</p>
